Add the remote and name it origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/Prj1.git
Now origin is created as the name for your remote repository.
Verify it
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (push)
If origin already exists and you want to change it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/newrepo.git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
If you need to remove and re-add
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <new-url>


Basic git pull Command
git pull
Fetches from the default remote (origin) and merges the current branch with the fetched changes.
With Rebase Example
git pull --rebase origin main
Good for keeping a cleaner commit history (linear).
With Fast-Forward Only
git pull --ff-only
Safer for CI/CD environments — avoids unintended merge commits.
Verbose Output
git pull --verbose
Useful for debugging fetch/merge steps.
Pull Unrelated Repos
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
Used when combining projects from different sources.


Basic git push Command
git push
Pushes your committed changes to the default remote (origin) and the current branch.
Push and set upstream:
git push -u origin main
-u or --set-upstream: Sets the default remote tracking for your branch.
Force push 
Overwrite remote:
git push --force origin main
--force will overwrite the remote branch no matter what — dangerous in shared repos.
Safer force push:
git push --force-with-lease origin main
--force-with-lease ensures:
You only overwrite the remote branch if it hasn’t changed since your last fetch.
If someone else pushed to origin/main after you last fetched, your push will be rejected — to avoid accidentally wiping their changes.



Delete a remote branch:
git push origin --delete feature-branch
Push tags:
git push origin --tags
Dry-run (just to test):
git push --dry-run
It tells you what would happen — like pushing the main branch — but nothing is actually pushed.
Check Current Upstream Tracking
git branch -vv
is super useful — it shows all local branches along with:
The tracking remote branch (if any)
The last commit hash
The latest commit message
Whether the branch is ahead/behind its remote

git push origin main:dev
Push local main branch to remote dev branch.

git push -u origin main

To https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
   b1a7a42..72e0d42  main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.

Now update files..
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
[main a7c2820] Initial commit
 2 files changed, 23 insertions(+)
git push --dry-run
To https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
   72e0d42..a7c2820  main -> main
git push


git clone
Creates a local copy of a remote repository (including all branches, commits, tags, etc.).
It’s used once to get the entire repo for the first time.
Example:
git clone https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
Result:
A new directory is created.
The full repo history and files are downloaded.
origin is automatically set as the remote.
Note that:
clone = Downloading a full app for the first time.
pull = Updating that app with the latest patch.
Note :
[GitHub repo] ==== clone ====> [Your computer]
[GitHub repo] ====> pull ====> [Your computer]
[Your computer] ====> push ====> [GitHub repo]



git fetch Syntax
git fetch [<options>] [<remote> [<refspec>...]]
Fetch from origin
git fetch origin
Downloads new commits from origin/main
Stores them in your local repo
DOES NOT change your working files or branches
Good for reviewing changes before merging
Fetch all remotes
git fetch --all

Fetch and clean up stale branches
git fetch --prune
Simulate a fetch
git fetch --dry-run
Fetch tags only
git fetch --tags
Fetch with full details
git fetch --verbose
Shallow fetch (last 5 commits)
git fetch --depth 5
Combine Options
git fetch --all --prune --verbose
Fetch from all remotes, clean up old branches, and show detailed output.





Fetch changes from origin
git fetch origin
Downloads updates from origin/main (the GitHub version of main)
But does not merge them into your local main yet
Compare local and remote
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
This shows the commits on origin/main that you don’t have locally yet.
Merge if you’re ready
git merge origin/main
Or just use:
git pull origin main
...if you’re okay with fetching + merging together.
Bonus Example with All-in-One
git fetch --all --prune --verbose
Fetches updates from all remotes
Removes stale references to deleted remote branches
Shows verbose output



git fetch = Download new mail, but don’t open it
git pull = Download + open + merge it into your current doc





What is a Patch?
A Git patch is a file that contains changes from one or more commits, allowing you to share, review, and apply changes without merging branches.

Creating a Patch (git format-patch)
You can create a patch file from the last N commits using:
git format-patch -N
Example: Create a patch file for the last 2 commits:
git format-patch -2
This generates files named like 0001-fix-bug.patch.
To create a patch from a specific commit range:
git format-patch <start-commit>..<end-commit>
Example:
git format-patch abc123..def456
This generates patches for commits between abc123 and def456.
