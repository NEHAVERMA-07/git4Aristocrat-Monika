Add the remote and name it origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/Prj1.git
Now origin is created as the name for your remote repository.
Verify it
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/monicag-gupta/gitAristrocat.git (push)
If origin already exists and you want to change it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/newrepo.git
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/monicag-gupta/NewRepoAris.git
If you need to remove and re-add
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <new-url>


Basic git pull Command
git pull
Fetches from the default remote (origin) and merges the current branch with the fetched changes.
With Rebase Example
git pull --rebase origin main
Good for keeping a cleaner commit history (linear).
With Fast-Forward Only
git pull --ff-only
Safer for CI/CD environments — avoids unintended merge commits.
Verbose Output
git pull --verbose
Useful for debugging fetch/merge steps.
Pull Unrelated Repos
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
Used when combining projects from different sources.


Basic git push Command
git push
Pushes your committed changes to the default remote (origin) and the current branch.
Push and set upstream:
git push -u origin main
-u or --set-upstream: Sets the default remote tracking for your branch.
Force push 
Overwrite remote:
git push --force origin main
--force will overwrite the remote branch no matter what — dangerous in shared repos.
Safer force push:
git push --force-with-lease origin main
--force-with-lease ensures:
You only overwrite the remote branch if it hasn’t changed since your last fetch.
If someone else pushed to origin/main after you last fetched, your push will be rejected — to avoid accidentally wiping their changes.
