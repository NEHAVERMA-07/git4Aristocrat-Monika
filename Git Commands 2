Example..Steps


Create an Initial File and Commit, Create a file called app.js and add some code:
echo 'console.log("Hello from main branch");' > app.js
Add and commit this file:
git add app.js
git commit -m "Initial commit with app.js"
Now we have a main branch with one file.
Create and Switch to a New Branch, Create a new branch feature-branch and switch to it:
git checkout -b feature-branch
Modify app.js:
echo 'console.log("Hello from feature branch");' > app.js
Stage and commit the changes:
git add app.js
git commit -m "Updated app.js in feature-branch"
Now, we have different versions of app.js in main and feature-branch.









Switch Back to Main and Modify the Same File
Switch back to main branch:
git checkout main
Modify app.js:
echo 'console.log("Hello from main branch - modified");' > app.js
Commit the changes:
git add app.js
git commit -m "Updated app.js in main"
Now, app.js is different in both main and feature-branch.
Merge feature-branch into main, Try merging the feature-branch:
git merge feature-branch
Git Conflict Detected!
You’ll see:
warning: Cannot merge binary files: app.js (HEAD vs. feature-branch)
Auto-merging app.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in app.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result..

Check the Conflict
git status
On branch main
….Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   app.js
…..
Open app.js and you’ll see: (VS Code provides an intuitive interface to compare and resolve conflicts.)
Resolve the Conflict
Now, manually edit app.js and keep the correct version:
Final app.js (Resolved)
console.log("Hello from main branch - modified");
console.log("Hello from feature branch");
Mark Conflict as Resolved

Now, stage the file:
git add app.js
Commit the merge:
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in app.js"
Conflict is now resolved!

Verify Merge History
Check the log:
git log --oneline --graph --all > aa.txt
This confirms the successful merge.

Alternative: Abort the Merge
If you want to cancel and undo the merge, run:
git merge --abort
This resets the repository back to before the merge.







git commit --amend (Amending the Last Commit)
Steps to Amend the Last Commit:
1. Create and Commit feature.js:
echo "console.log('Initial commit');" > feature.js
git add feature.js
git commit -m "Initial commit with feature.js"
Modify the Commit Message or Content: 
Let's say we realize that the commit message is incorrect or we forgot to add some changes. We want to amend it.
Modify the files you want to change.
For example, edit a file or add new content:
echo "console.log('Updated feature')" >> feature.js
2. Stage the changes:
git add feature.js
3. Amend the last commit:
To set Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your default Git editor, you can use the following command:
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
Open amend of commit in VS code
git commit --amend
This will open your default text editor, allowing you to change the commit message if needed. The changes you made will now be part of the amended commit.
If you just want to change the commit message (without modifying the content), you can use:
git commit --amend --no-edit
The --no-edit flag keeps the commit message unchanged.
4. Push the changes (if the commit has already been pushed to a remote): 
If you've already pushed the original commit, you'll need to force push:
Dont run this:
git push --force
Be careful when force-pushing to shared repositories, as this can overwrite history for others.








1. Create Multiple Commits: First, we’ll create three commits to practice rebase:
echo "console.log('Commit 1');" > feature.js
git add feature.js
git commit -m "Commit 1"

echo "console.log('Commit 2');" >> feature.js
git add feature.js
git commit -m "Commit 2"

echo "console.log('Commit 3');" >> feature.js
git add feature.js
git commit -m "Commit 3"

2. Check the status to identify the unstaged changes:
git status
This will show any modified or untracked files that need to be addressed before proceeding.
Stash the changes (if you don't want to commit them yet): If you want to temporarily save the changes and proceed with the rebase, you can stash them:
git stash
This will store your changes temporarily and leave your working directory clean.
Proceed with the Interactive Rebase: 
Once your working directory is clean, you can proceed with the interactive rebase:
git rebase -i HEAD~3

3. Edit the Commit List: Your default editor will open with a list of commits:
pick 1a2b3c4 Commit message 1
pick 5d6e7f8 Commit message 2
pick 9a0b1c2 Commit message 3


You can change the command next to each commit:
pick: Keep the commit as is.
reword: Change the commit message.
edit: Amend the commit (useful for changing files).
squash: Combine this commit with the previous one.
fixup: Similar to squash, but discards the commit message.
drop: Remove the commit.


For example, to squash the last two commits into one:
pick 1a2b3c4 Commit message 1
squash 5d6e7f8 Commit message 2
pick 9a0b1c2 Commit message 3

4. Save and Exit: 
After making your changes, save and exit the editor (for example, in Vim, press Esc, type :wq, and hit Enter).
5. Resolve Conflicts (If Any): 
Resolve any conflicts (if necessary): If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will prompt you to resolve them. 
After resolving conflicts, use:
git rebase --continue
If there are conflicts during the rebase, Git will stop and allow you to resolve them. 
After fixing the conflicts, stage the changes:
git add <file>
Then, continue the rebase:
git rebase --continue
6. Apply the Stashed Changes (if you stashed them): After completing the rebase, you can apply your stashed changes:
git stash pop
7. Force Push (If Needed): 
If you've already pushed your changes, you may need to force push the rewritten history:
git push --force








Sometimes, you may accidentally lose a commit or move the branch reference to an unintended commit. 
git reflog allows you to view and recover these lost commits.
Steps to Recover Lost Commits:
1. Create Commits:
Create the first commit
echo "console.log('Initial commit');" > feature1.js
git add feature1.js
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a second commit
echo "console.log('Second commit');" >> feature1.js
git add feature1.js
git commit -m "Second commit"
Create a third commit
echo "console.log('Third commit');" >> feature1.js
git add feature1.js
git commit -m "Third commit"

2. View the Commit History
Before we simulate a lost commit, let's check the commit history:
git log --oneline
Output (example commit hashes will differ):
3024c8a (HEAD -> main) Third commit
631218a Second commit
8a9a2ce Initial commit
…
3. Delete (Lose) the Latest Commit
Now, let’s assume we mistakenly reset to an earlier commit, losing the latest commit.
git reset --hard HEAD~1
HEAD is now at 631218a Second commit
This will remove the latest commit (Third commit) from the history.
Check the commit log again:
git log --oneline
Output:
631218a (HEAD -> main) Second commit
8a9a2ce Initial commit
..
The "Third commit" is gone from the history!

Steps to Recover Lost Commits:
4. View the Reflog: Recover the Lost Commit using git reflog
At this point, Git still tracks where HEAD has moved in the past, and we can use git reflog to find the lost commit.
The git reflog command shows the history of changes to the HEAD reference, including commits that were removed, rebased, or reset.
git reflog
Output (example commit hashes will differ):
631218a (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
e911ea1 HEAD@{1}: commit: Third commit
631218a (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{2}: commit: Second commit
8a9a2ce HEAD@{3}: commit: Initial commit 
..
The commit 3024c8a (Third commit) is still accessible via reflog.
5. Find the Commit: 
Look through the reflog output for the commit you want to recover. 
Note the commit hash (e.g., 3024c8a).
6. To restore it, simply run:
git reset --hard e911ea1
HEAD is now at 3024c8a Third commit

7. Verify the Recovery
Check the log again:
git log --oneline
Output:
3024c8a (HEAD -> main) Third commit
631218a Second commit
8a9a2ce Initial commit 
..
The "Third commit" has been recovered successfully!






Scenario: 
You Are Working on a Feature, but Need to Switch Branches.
You are working on feature-branch and made some changes, but suddenly you need to switch to main to fix a bug. 
Instead of committing your half-done work, you can use git stash.

1. Create a New Repository and Initialize Git
mkdir git-stash-demo
cd git-stash-demo
git init

2. Create a File and Make Some Changes
echo "First line of code" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "New feature in progress" >> file.txt
echo "Temporary work" >> temp.txt   # This is an untracked file

At this point:
file.txt is modified.
temp.txt is untracked.

Using Git Stash Commands:
3. Stash the Changes
Stash only tracked files
git stash
Only file.txt is stashed; temp.txt remains untracked.
Stash tracked + untracked files
git stash -u
Now temp.txt is also stashed.
Note that git stash removed temp.txt (untracked file)
To restore back the file, use:
git stash apply "stash@{0}"
Stash everything (tracked, untracked, ignored)
git stash -a
Stash with a message
git stash push -m "Saving work on feature"

4. View the Stash List
git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on feature-branch: Saving work on feature
stash@{1}: WIP on feature-branch: auto-stash
5. Switch to Another Branch
git checkout main
Now you can work on fixing the bug in main.
6. Apply Stashed Changes
After fixing the bug, switch back to your feature branch:
git checkout feature-branch
Apply the latest stash (but keep it in the stash list)
git stash apply
Your changes are restored.
Apply a specific stash (without removing it)
git stash apply stash@{0}
Pop the stash (apply and remove it)
git stash pop
This applies and removes the stash.


7. Dropping and Clearing Stashes
Drop a specific stash
git stash drop "stash@{0}"
Clear all stashes
git stash clear
Final Cleanup
git stash list  # Verify if any stashes are left
8. Restoring Individual Files
If you only need to restore a single file from the stash:
git checkout "stash@{0}" -- file.txt
9. Create a New Branch from a Stash
If your work is significant and needs its own branch:
git stash branch new-feature-branch
This creates new-feature-branch and applies the stash.




Stashing Selectively (--patch):

Commit all previous work:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git diff
No output expected
Create a file and commit it: 
Create a new file  in VS Code: 
example.txt
Add lines to it:
Line 1: Initial content
Line 2: Stable version 
Save the file
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit with example.txt"

Make Changes to the File
Modify the file: Add the lines
Line 3: First change
Line 4: Second change
Save the file
Check the changes:
git diff
Expected output:
diff --git a/example.txt b/example.txt
index fe58729..b7f45f7 100644
--- a/example.txt
+++ b/example.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,4 @@

-Line 2: Stable version
\ No newline at end of file
+Line 2: Stable version^M
+Line 3: First change^M
+Line 4: Second change

Stash Only Selected Changes
git stash --patch
Git will interactively ask you about each change:
diff --git a/example.txt b/example.txt
..
\ No newline at end of file
(1/1) Stash this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,e,p,?]?
Here’s a breakdown of what each option does:
y: Yes – Stash the current hunk of changes (accept the changes).
n: No – Do not stash the current hunk of changes (skip this hunk).
q: Quit – Exit the stashing process and don't stash any changes.
a: All – Stash all the changes in the file (i.e., all hunks). This will automatically accept all changes in the file.
d: Done – Stop stashing after the current hunk. This can be used when you've finished selecting which hunks to stash.
e: Edit – Open the current hunk in an editor to modify what changes will be stashed. You can manually select or remove parts of the changes.
p: Patch – Allow you to interactively select specific lines to stash. This will let you decide which specific lines from the current hunk to keep.
For this example, press y to stash only the first hunk.
Output:
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 2f131e6 Initial commit with example.txt
Check the stash list:
git stash list
Confirm only selected changes were stashed.
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 2f131e6 Initial commit with example.txt
Confirm the file status:
git status
Output:
PS C:\Users\monica\Desktop\Egs\GitEgs111> git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 14 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
Check the remaining unstashed changes:
git diff
Output: nothing
Apply or Pop the Stash
Apply the stash (keep it in the stash list):
git stash apply
Apply and remove the stash from the list:
git stash pop
Clean Up
If you no longer need the stash:
In Linux:
git stash drop stash@{0}
In Windows Power Shell:
git stash drop stash@`{0`}
To remove all stashes:
git stash clear


Create a New File and Commit It
echo "Initial content" > myfile.txt
git add myfile.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit with myfile.txt"
Modify the File Without Committing
echo "New changes" >> myfile.txt
Stash myfile.txt
git stash push -m "Stashing only myfile.txt" -- myfile.txt
The -m option gives the stash a message.
The -- myfile.txt ensures only this file is stashed.
Output
Saved working directory and index state On main: Stashing only myfile.txt
